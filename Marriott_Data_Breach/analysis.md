Analysis of the Marriott Data Breach
a. Who were the victims of the attack?

The victims of the Marriott data breach were approximately 500 million guests whose personal information was compromised. This included both past and current customers of the Marriott International hotel chain.

b. What technologies and tools were used in the attack?

The breach was executed through a combination of advanced persistent threats (APT) and exploitation of vulnerabilities in Marriott's systems. The attackers used a compromised network to gain access to the guest reservation database, which contained sensitive personal and payment information. The specific tools and malware used were not publicly detailed, but the attack involved sophisticated techniques likely including SQL injection and phishing.

c. When did the attack happen within the network?

The breach was initially discovered in September 2018, but the attackers are believed to have gained unauthorized access to Marriott’s systems as early as 2014. The attackers had access to the systems for several years before the breach was detected.

d. What systems were targeted?

The attackers targeted the Starwood guest reservation database, which Marriott had acquired in 2016. This database contained a wide range of personal information including names, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, and payment card details.

e. What was the motivation of the attackers in this case? What did they hope to achieve?

The motivation behind the Marriott data breach is speculated to be financial gain or espionage. By accessing sensitive personal and financial data, the attackers could potentially commit identity theft, financial fraud, or use the stolen data for other malicious purposes. It is also possible that the breach was part of a broader espionage campaign targeting valuable business or political information.

f. What was the outcome of the attack?

The outcome of the Marriott data breach included significant financial and reputational damage to Marriott International. The breach led to:

Financial Impact: Marriott faced substantial costs related to legal fees, regulatory fines, and remediation efforts.
Reputational Damage: The breach damaged Marriott’s reputation and trust with customers, impacting their brand image.
Regulatory Scrutiny: The breach led to investigations by regulatory bodies, including the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and other data protection authorities.
Compromised Data: The personal information of up to 500 million guests was stolen, including sensitive details such as passport numbers and payment information.
